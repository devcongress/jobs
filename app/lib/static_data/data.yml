# Static data: because some things don't change.
# =============================================
# 
# The values below could be stored in a database (as industries were), but that
# incurs network and garbage collection cost. The values don't change, or rarely
# do, as such we can hold them in memory for the entire duration the application
# is up. Saves us both network and garbage collection cost, at a small price.
